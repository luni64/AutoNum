# AutoNumber

## Overview
AutoNumber is a specialized tool designed for genealogists, enabling easy identification of individuals in group photos. The software automatically adds numbered markers to people in images, making it easier to reference them in other documents. These markers can be adjusted manually, and their appearance can be customized to match personal preferences or the style of the indexed photos. AutoNumber supports all common image formats, including JPG, TIF, and PNG.
